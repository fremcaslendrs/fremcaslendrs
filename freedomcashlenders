The cash flow statement is a part of a company's financial statement that tracks its actual cash movements, providing a clear picture of liquidity and its financial lifeblood. Unlike the income statement, which records revenues and expenses based on accrual accounting, the cash flow statement focuses on actual cash inflows and outflows, helping stakeholders assess a company's ability to sustain operations, invest in growth, and manage obligations.

It complements the balance sheet by explaining changes in cash balances and reconciling non-cash transactions from the income statement to reveal how much profit actually converts into cash. By analyzing these activities, investors can identify trends, detect potential cash flow issues, and make informed financial decisions.
