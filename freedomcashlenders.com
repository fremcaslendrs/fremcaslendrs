To assess a company's financial health, you have to understand its cash flow statement. It reveals how cash moves through a business, including operations, investments, and financing activities. The cash flow statement highlights liquidity, showing whether a company can generate enough cash to sustain itself, invest in growth and meet its financial obligations.

Whether you're an investor, business owner, or analyst, learning how to prepare, read, and analyze a cash flow statement will help you identify trends, spot red flags, and make informed financial decisions with confidence.
