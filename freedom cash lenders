 This section of the cash flow statement shows how cash flows from a company's core business operations, and whether the company can sustain itself without external financing. Cash inflows come from revenue, interest, and dividends. Cash outflows include payments to suppliers. employee wages, rent, utilities, and taxes.
Positive operating cash flow means a business is generating enough cash to cover expenses, whereas negative cash flow may signal inefficiencies in working capital.
